summary: Sunbeam fork of an operator to provide self-signed X.509 certificates to your charms.

description: |
  This is a fork used by Sunbeam to get a 24.04 version, please use:
  https://charmhub.io/self-signed-certificates

  An operator to provide self-signed X.509 certificates to your charms.

  This charm relies on the `tls-certificates` charm relation interface. When a requirer charm
  inserts a Certificate Signing Request in its unit databag, the
  `self-signed-certificates-operator` will read it, generate a self-signed X.509 certificates and
  inserts this certificate back into the relation data.

  This charm is useful when developing charms or when deploying charms in non-production environment.
